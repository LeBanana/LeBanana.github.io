	<h3>Blog Post 2</h3>
	<pre>
	In this post I have managed to sort out the ENTER_FRAME commands to move the character wiht no delay, 
	and also fixed some bugs with the animations. The deadzone has been implemented as well as the collisions. 
	Each collision has a one time activation as having multiple wouldnt make sense, as both are bombs explode.
	The first collision had some bugs, such as when the character reached it the animation would bug out, and not play correctly.
	I added some booleans to fix this, which would also disable all the movement commands so you cant move until the collision event is done.
	I did this with both events as it was needed so the animations could play uninterrupted.
	There is still a bug with the second collisions animation resetting, will have to look into it further.
	The last things to do would be to implement a stage zone(where you can walk, so you stop before walking off into nothing).
	Then see if I can do a infinite scrolling background.Then to work on the jump code and animation, and finally do the turn animation.
	I will need to run a clean up to see which code I can remove, or is not doing anything, as to clean it up.
